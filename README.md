ICS-4U1 Project

This was orignally a school project for computer science. I am probably not going to work on it much anymore, but if anyone wants to continue working on it that would be grand. It has bare functionality already implemented, so it's a functional game. I haven't seen any bugs which haven't been fixed so it's pretty good for version 1.0.

What needs to be done is refactoring a lot of code. I really hate the inventory system right now, and the GUI state system needs work too. I tried implementing it as an enum but have run into some troubles, and it looks a lot dirtier that way since it keeps referencing a static GUI. I think that a class based approach would suit it better, but I put up the branch just in case with the enums.
